  <h1>About Me...</h1>
<p>Hello my name is Priyanshu Karmakar. <br/>
I have done Btech in Computer Science and Information Technology from KIIT University, Odissa.</p>

<p>Currently I am prepairing for GATE Exam 2024.<br />

  Note that I have failed two time consecutively from the year 2022. Currently I am losing my confidence.
  People who are closest to me started to think that I am donw with my life and now I am a complete wastage.
  I am also losing interest upon me.<br>
  But I know that I can do. I can achieve AIR 1 in GATE 2024 Exam. I will do it.
  <br>
</p>
<p> I have'nt sit for my college placements although the placements are more or less good, and even after knowing that I will eventually land on "safe" product-based company,
  I restrain myself from that field, and chosen the field o hogher education.
  Also in future I wanted to complete Masters in Mathematics.
  And ended up on proffesorship in Mathematical-computing field.(if it exist!)

</p>
<p><i>PLEASE NOTE THAT if in future I made this website live, do know that this is my first website I'm creating and try to avoid reading and minding any such articles like the above one.
  <br>
  THANK YOU
